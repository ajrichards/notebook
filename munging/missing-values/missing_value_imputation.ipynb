    "\n",
    "### Just ignore it\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest (and worst) way to deal with missing data is to **ignore it**. That is, simply run the analysis, missing values and all, hoping for the best. If your software is any good, this approach will simply not work; the algorithm will try to operate on data that includes missing values, and propagate them, resulting in statistics and estimates that cannot be calculated, which will typically raise errors. If your software is poor, it will make some assumption or decision about the missing values, and proceed to generate  results conditional on the assumption, which creates problems that may never be detected because no indication was given to any potential problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Take only the complete case analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The next easiest (worst) approach to analyzing data with missing values is to conduct list-wise deletion, by deleting the records that have missing values. This is called **complete case analysis**, because only records that are complete get retained for the analysis. The degree to which complete case analysis is undesirable depends on the mechanism by which data have become missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Missingness\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about Bias and Power\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Missing completely at random (MCAR)**: When data are MCAR, missing cases are, on average, identical to non-missing cases, with respect to the model. Ignoring the missingness will reduce the power of the analysis, but will not bias inference.\n",
    "- **Missing at random (MAR)**: Missing data depends (usually probabilistically) on measured values, and hence can be modeled by variables observed in the data set. Accounting for the values which “cause” the missing data will produce unbiased results in an analysis.\n",
    "- **Missing not at random(MNAR)**: Missing data depend on unmeasured or unknown variables. There is no information available to account for the missingness.\n",
    "\n",
    "The very best-case scenario for using complete case analysis, which corresponds to MCAR missingness, results in a **loss of power** due to the reduction in sample size. The analysis will lose the information contained in the non-missing elements of a partially-missing record. When data are not missing completely at random, inferences from complete case analysis may be **biased** due to systematic differences between missing and non-missing records that affects the estimates of key parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "One alternative to complete case analysis is to simply fill (*impute*) the missing values with a reasonable guess a the true value, such as the mean, median or modal value of the fully-observed records. This imputation, while not recovering any information regarding the missing value itself for use in the analysis, does provide a mechanism for including the non-missing values in the analysis, thereby making use of all available information."

    "This approach may be reasonable under the MCAR assumption, but may induce bias under a MAR scenario, whereby missing values may **differ systematically** relative to non-missing values, making the particular summary statistic used for imputation *biased* as a mean/median/modal value for the missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond this, the use of a single imputed value to stand in place of the actual missing value glosses over the **uncertainty** associated with this guess at the true value. Any subsequent analysis procedure (*e.g.* regression analysis) will behave as if the imputed value were observed, despite the fact that we are actually unsure of the actual value for the missing variable. The practical consequence of this is that the variance of any estimates resulting from the imputed dataset will be **artificially reduced**."

    "## Multiple Imputation\n",
    "\n",
    "One robust alternative to addressing missing data is **multiple imputation** (Schaffer 1999, van Buuren 2012). It produces unbiased parameter estimates, while simultaneously accounting for the uncertainty associated with imputing missing values. It is conceptually and mechanistically straightforward, and produces complete datasets that may be analyzed using any statistical methodology or software one chooses, as if the data had no missing values to begin with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple imputation generates imputed values based on a **regression model**. This regression model will help us generate reasonable values, particularly if data are MAR, since it uses information in the dataset that may be informative in predicting what the true value may be. Ideally, we want predictor variables that are **correlated** with the missing variable, and with the mechanism of missingness, if any. For example, one might be able to use test scores from one subject to predict missing test scores from another; or, the probability of income reporting to be missing may vary systematically according to the education level of the individual.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see if there is any potential information among the variables in our dataset to use for imputation, it is helpful to calculate the pairwise correlation between all the variables. Since we have discrete variables in our data, the [Spearman rank correlation coefficient](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Spearman%27s_rank_correlation_coefficient) is appropriate."

    "However, this is still just a single imputation for each missing value, and hence glosses over the uncertainty associated with the derivation of the imputes. Multiple imputation proceeds by **imputing several values**, to generate several complete datasets and performing the same analysis on all of them. With a set of estimates in hand, an *average* estimate of model parameters can be obtained that more adequately accounts for the uncertainty, hopefully providing more robust inference than from a single impute.\n",

    "There are a variety of ways to generate multiple imputations. Here, we will exploit **regularization** in order to do this. The `LogisticRegression` class from scikit-learn provides facilities for regularization using either L2 (resulting in ridge regression) or L1 (resulting in LASSO regression) penalties. The degree of regularization in either case is controlled by the `C` parameter, whereby large values of `C` give more freedom to the model, while smaller values of `C` constrain the model more. We can use a selection of `C` values to obtain a range of predictions from variants of the same model. For example:"
